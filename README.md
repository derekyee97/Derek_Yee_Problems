The "convert_String_To_Int.java" file is my solution for taking a string input, and converting it to an integer. It should take into account strings that have non-numeric values, and prompts the user if they would want to convert it to its ascii value instead. If not then the program will ignore non-numeric values, otherwise it will include their ascii values when converting. I also tried to handle negative values, and if the conversion will result in an interger underflow or overflow. The main function will test the funtionality of the program by prompting the user to enter a string, and converting it to an integer which will then be printed out. 


The "contains_Integer.java" file is my solution for taking a string input and seeing if there is a number within it. The main function will test the functionality of the method that confirms if an integer is residing in the string.
